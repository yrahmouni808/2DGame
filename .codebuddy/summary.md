# Project Summary

## Overview
This project is a 2D game developed using Java, which utilizes various frameworks and libraries to manage game assets, handle collisions, and facilitate game mechanics. The project appears to be structured to support a classic adventure or platformer style of gameplay, featuring character movement, object interactions, and map management.

### Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
- **Language**: Java
- **Frameworks**: Likely uses Java's built-in libraries for graphics and event handling (e.g., AWT, Swing).
- **Main Libraries**: Not explicitly stated, but may include libraries for image handling and game loop management.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the project is to create a 2D game that allows players to navigate through various maps, interact with objects, and control a character. The game includes features such as collision detection, asset management, and user input handling.
